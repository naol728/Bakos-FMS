# BAKOS Saving and Credit Cooperative Information Management System

A **web-based financial management system** designed to digitize and automate the operations of a saving and credit cooperative.  
The system replaces manual, paper-based workflows with a **secure, scalable, and role-driven platform** for managing members, savings, loans, approvals, and financial reporting.

## 📌 Project Overview

BAKOS Saving and Credit Cooperative Information Management System is built to address common challenges faced by cooperatives, including:

- Data redundancy and inconsistency
- Manual interest calculations
- Slow loan approval workflows
- Limited financial visibility
- Inefficient reporting and record management

The system introduces **centralized data management**, **automated financial logic**, and **multi-role workflows** to improve accuracy, transparency, and operational efficiency.
